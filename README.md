# [Deprecated] Candy Exercise
_**The current version of this activity has been migrated to [Ada-Activites](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/Candy-Exercise).**_
## Directions

1. In `get_friends_favorite_candy_count()`, return a dictionary of candy names and the
amount of times each candy appears in the `friend_favorites` list.

```python
friend_favorites = [
    ["Sally", ["lollipop", "bubble gum", "laffy taffy" ]],
    ["Bob", ["milky way", "licorice", "lollipop" ]],
    ["Arlene", ["chocolate bar", "milky way", "laffy taffy" ]],
    ["Carlie", ["nerds", "sour patch kids", "laffy taffy" ]]
]
```

2. Given the list `friend_favorites`, create 
a new data structure in the function `create_new_candy_data_structure` 
that describes the different kinds of candy paired with a list of friends that 
like that candy. 

```python
friend_favorites = [
    ["Sally", ["lollipop", "bubble gum", "laffy taffy" ]],
    ["Bob", ["milky way", "licorice", "lollipop" ]],
    ["Arlene", ["chocolate bar", "milky way", "laffy taffy" ]],
    ["Carlie", ["nerds", "sour patch kids", "laffy taffy" ]]
]
```

3. In `get_friends_who_like_specified_candy()`, return 
a tuple of friends who like the candy specified in the candy_name parameter.

4. In, `create_candy_set()`, return a set of all the candies from
the data structure made in `create_new_candy_data_structure()`.

5. Starting with nominal cases, write tests for each of the functions 
in the file tests/test_candy_data_structure.py then write tests to 
handle edge cases.
